Anonfilly's Battle of Love","date":"2025-02-28","from":"6:30 PM GMT-0500","unixtime":1740785400000,"duration":180,"description":"Another rousing game of CYOA Live! In this quest, Hearts and Hooves day is just around the corner and of course, Anonfilly hasn't found a special somepony. Clearly the only solution is to fix this. As you begin your Ponyville morning, (You) must battle both the democracy of the polls and the dice to find a solution to your dilemma. Will (You) find a filly-free pony? Will (You) become a terrorist of the heart, removing the holiday from Equestrian Calendars? Or, will (You) just decide to pursue wizard-hood, and fuck, I don't know, kill Spike again and usurp Celestia's throne?\nAs usual, during this CYOA panel, anything goes so long as luck and the people are on your side, from thermo-nuclear fission to abandoning the quest for loftier goals, the game doesn't end until we run out of time. Each scene will be hand-doodled by me after each vote and roll during a short \"loading\" section. If you've never participated in one of these, here's a link to the previous CYOA Live! so you can begin cooking your evil, awful schemes to make this run into another masterpiece: https://pony.tube/w/t7Wtodz3evrbNe2v65oGSy","ch":["https://cytu.be/r/marecon"]},{"title":"Writing a letter to Hasbro","date":"2025-02-28","from":"10:00 PM GMT-0500","unixtime":1740798000000,"duration":300,"description":"Want to tell Hasbro how much you love the direction they've taken MLP?
